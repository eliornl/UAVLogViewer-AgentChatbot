## ü§ñ AI Agent Capabilities

The UAV Log Viewer implements a sophisticated AI agent based on the ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) paradigm, combining LLM reasoning with specialized analytical tools.

### üí¨ Enhanced User Interaction

The agent features an advanced interaction system optimized for telemetry analysis workflows:

- **Intent Classification**: Accurately categorizes user queries into analytical types (anomaly detection, parameter analysis, flight phase investigation) to select appropriate processing paths.

- **Greeting & Off-Topic Management**: Efficiently handles non-analytical queries without triggering expensive data operations, providing contextual guidance while preserving system resources.

- **Adaptive Assistance**: Dynamically adjusts response detail and suggestion specificity based on query clarity and user expertise level.

- **Resource Lifecycle Management**: Automatically cleans up sessions and releases database connections when users navigate away or close their browser.

### üí≠ Dynamic Memory Architecture

The agent implements an adaptive memory system that automatically selects the appropriate strategy based on conversation length and complexity:

**Memory Strategy Selection**

The Conversation Memory Manager dynamically transitions between memory strategies as the conversation evolves:

- **Short-Term Strategy** (< 1,000 tokens): Uses a token-aware buffer window that preserves recent messages while respecting token limits.

- **Medium-Term Strategy** (1,000-3,000 tokens): Combines buffer memory with a summarization mechanism that condenses older conversation turns into compact summaries.

- **Advanced Strategy** (> 3,000 tokens): Combines buffer memory, summarization, and vector-based retrieval using FAISS with time-weighted decay to maintain relevance.

- **Fallback Strategy**: Implements aggressive summarization when token limits are exceeded, ensuring conversations can continue indefinitely.

This progressive approach ensures optimal context preservation while managing token usage efficiently, allowing the system to maintain coherent conversations over extended sessions without performance degradation.

### üîç Specialized Analytical Tools

The agent leverages purpose-built tools for telemetry analysis:

- **SQL Query Generation**: Converts natural language to optimized DuckDB queries with schema awareness.

- **Anomaly Detection**: Implements Isolation Forest with configurable sensitivity parameters for identifying statistical outliers across telemetry parameters.

- **Flight Phase Analysis**: Segments flight data into takeoff, cruise, and landing phases for targeted investigation.

- **Parameter Correlation**: Identifies relationships between telemetry parameters for root cause analysis.

### üîß System Integration

The agent is fully integrated with the core system architecture:

- **Strongly Typed Interfaces**: All agent inputs and outputs use Pydantic models for validation.

- **Concurrent Processing**: Leverages asyncio for non-blocking operation during complex analyses.

- **Error Handling**: Implements graceful degradation with informative user feedback.

- **Session Isolation**: Maintains independent agent state per user session with proper resource management.

---

## üîÑ WebSocket Integration

The UAV Log Viewer implements a bidirectional WebSocket communication system for real-time token streaming with automatic HTTP fallback for maximum reliability.

### Implementation Details

- **Connection Pool Management**: Session-isolated WebSocket connections with proper lifecycle tracking.
- **Binary Frame Optimization**: Uses binary WebSocket frames for 15-20% lower latency compared to text frames.
- **Heartbeat Mechanism**: 30-second ping/pong cycle to detect and manage stale connections.
- **Backpressure Handling**: Token buffer with configurable high-water mark to prevent client overflow.
- **Error Recovery**: Implements exponential backoff for reconnection attempts with jitter.

## üìä Telemetry Processing Pipeline

The UAV Log Viewer features a high-throughput processing pipeline that transforms raw MAVLink binary logs into optimized analytical data structures through a multi-stage ETL process.

---

## üìù Telemetry Schema Intelligence

At the heart of the UAV Log Viewer's natural language understanding lies the Telemetry Schema Intelligence - a powerful semantic layer connecting raw telemetry data to human-friendly insights.

### ‚ú® Schema Intelligence Features

- **üó∫Ô∏è Knowledge Graph**: Comprehensive mapping of telemetry parameters including relationships and rich metadata.

- **üîç Semantic Search**: Vector-based similarity search powered by OpenAI embeddings and FAISS for precise context retrieval.

- **üìù Parameter Context**: Detailed descriptions, units, expected ranges, and anomaly indicators for each telemetry parameter.

- **‚öôÔ∏è SQL Translation**: Converts natural language queries into optimized, schema-aware SQL statements.

- **üìä Result Interpretation**: Applies domain expertise to provide meaningful, contextual analysis of query results.

### üí° System Integration

The Telemetry Schema Intelligence system is deeply integrated throughout the UAV Log Viewer application to enhance various components:

- **üß† AI Reasoning**: Supplies domain-specific knowledge that guides the agent's analysis strategies and response generation.

- **üíæ Database Layer**: Informs query optimization by aiding table selection and join strategies for efficient data retrieval.

- **üìà Visualization**: Recommends suitable visualization types based on parameter characteristics and their relationships.

- **üíé Anomaly Detection**: Establishes baseline expectations to detect unusual patterns and potential issues in flight telemetry data.

---

## üîé Vector Search Technology

The UAV Log Viewer employs advanced neural embedding and approximate nearest neighbor search technologies to enable semantic retrieval of conversation context and telemetry knowledge.

### ‚ú® Vector Store Implementation

- **üìö FAISS Integration**: Uses Facebook AI Similarity Search for efficient vector operations with optimized nearest-neighbor algorithms.

- **üßê OpenAI Embeddings**: Provides high-quality semantic representations (text-embedding-ada-002) with 1,536 dimensions for precise similarity matching.

- **üì¶ Batched Processing**: Implements cost-efficient embedding generation with proper rate limiting and error handling.

- **‚è±Ô∏è Time-Weighted Retrieval**: Enhances search relevance by applying decay functions to boost recent information in conversation context.

### üî• Key Innovations

**Time-weighted Retrieval** enhances search relevance by boosting similarity scores for recent conversation turns. An exponential decay function maintains contextual freshness, controlled via a configurable half-life parameter. This approach balances semantic meaning with recency to ensure results remain timely and pertinent.

**Multi-tier Memory Architecture** structures memory into three layers: a sliding window buffer for immediate context (~300 tokens), a medium-term memory summarized by the language model (~1,500 tokens), and an unlimited, vector-indexed long-term memory. This design dynamically selects relevant context based on query demands and token limits.

**Hybrid Search** combines vector similarity with exact keyword matching, using a blended ranking algorithm that balances both methods. Metadata-aware filtering refines results further, optimizing retrieval for specialized telemetry domain terminology.

## üîí Security Considerations

UAV Log Viewer is built with strong security principles to ensure the integrity of telemetry data and the safety of user interactions.

Session isolation ensures that each user operates in a sandboxed environment with dedicated locking mechanisms. All incoming inputs are rigorously validated through Pydantic models, enforcing strict data integrity. Request rate limiting protects the API from abuse, while structured error handling prevents accidental information disclosure. Sensitive configurations, such as API keys and credentials, are securely managed through environment variables.
